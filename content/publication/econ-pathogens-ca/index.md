abstract: The State Water Resources Control Board is proposing to amend the statewide Water Quality Control Plans for Inland Surface Waters, Enclosed Bays and Estuaries and the Water Quality Control Plan for Ocean Waters of California to include updated water quality objectives for bacteria to protect human health for the beneficial use of water contact recreation (REC-1) in fresh and marine waters. Under a contract with the United States Environmental Protection Agency, Abt Associates and PG Environmental provided the State Water Board with an analysis of economic factors related to the proposal, including compliance with the water quality objective options, available methods to achieve compliance with these options, and the costs of those methods.
